### Earlier projects:

1. Analysis of blockchain mining strategy based on MDP
  * This project aims to analyse the best way to mining in proof of work blockchain in order to make maximum profit.
  * [View the project](https://github.com/doris-lessing/Selfish-Mining-Simulator)
  * [View my thesis](https://github.com/doris-lessing/Blockchain_attack_MDP) (This page shows main idea and results, thesis in the repository was written in Chinese.)
  
2. Image processing algorithms implements
  * This project is meant to implements some classical alogorithms in image processing to get a deeper understanding of them. This is a homework project.
