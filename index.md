### Projects in progress:
1. Optimization of payment network channel
  * Supervised by professor Zhixuan Fang, Tsinghua University

### Earlier projects:

1. Analysis of blockchain attacks based on MDP
  * This project aims to analyse the resilience of the bitcoin system to several attacks using MDP model and simulation.
  * [View the project](https://github.com/doris-lessing/Selfish-Mining-Simulator)
  * [View my thesis](https://github.com/doris-lessing/Blockchain_attack_MDP) (This page shows main idea and results, thesis in the repository was written in Chinese.)
  
2. Image processing algorithms implements
  * This project is meant to implements some classical alogorithms in image processing to get a deeper understanding of them.
  * [View the project of image transformation](https://github.com/zhangyilang/ImageTransform)

4. Social network analysis and reference system construction on Bilibili
  * Crawled data from bilibili.com, analyzed the social network of bilibili and constructed an reference system using Local Random Walk.
  * [View the paper](https://github.com/doris-lessing/Social_Network_Mining_on_Bilibili/blob/master/Social%20network%20analysis%20and%20reference%20system%20construction%20on%20Bilibili.pdf)
5. Social network analysis in Chinese rural primary schools
  * We collected questionnaires about the background and social relationships of 227 primary school students when teaching as volunteers. This project focuses on the social network among the students.
